# Mobile Version

Best Practice
Repo/Branch Management
Do not push directly to main

Create a feature branch for each task
git checkout -b feature/<branch-name>
Commit Messages
Use a clear format similar to this one

[<type>] Scope: short description

ex:

[feature] API: Added New Endpoint
[fix] Users: Fixed Email Verification
Pull Requests
Open a pull request to main for every change

Include a clear title and description
Request a review or ask in Discord
Code Quality
Test code extensively

Write clear, readable code with meaningful variable names

Include comments when necessary

Use a .env for any sensitive credentials
